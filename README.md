AVRO project
============

Here are the pages of the website - my second student project Avro. I did the sesearch in a field of conservation and developed the concept of the app which could help conservators in their daily work: manage projects, make a catalog of conservated / restorated objects, check temperature and humidity, prepare documentation for clients.

Here is the short presentation with the idea.
